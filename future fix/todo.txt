Timeline

Missing app: Application03_Toggle_HDR
Bug: pushing a button (like download) in the projects menus open the menu as well.
The photos in the Project look distorted (see pic 05)
In the top menu: Timeline should appear AFTER Projects (same order as the website)
Change the donwload link to the latest release: see â†’ https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/linking-to-releases
